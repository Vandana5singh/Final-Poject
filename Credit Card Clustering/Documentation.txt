**Topic: Segmentation of Credit Card Customers**

**Overview:**
The objective of this project is to categorize credit card consumers according to their patterns of expenditure. Customer segmentation is an essential undertaking in marketing and customer relationship management. It enables firms to customize their products and services to suit particular consumer groups.

**Data set:**
The dataset utilized encompassed comprehensive details regarding credit card customers, encompassing their account balances, purchasing patterns, credit limits, and further pertinent information. The collection has 8950 records and encompasses 18 distinct characteristics.

**Data Preprocessing:**
1. Excluded the 'CUST_ID' column from the dataset since it did not contribute to the clustering analysis.
2. Addressed missing values in the 'CREDIT_LIMIT' and 'MINIMUM_PAYMENTS' columns by removing rows with missing 'CREDIT_LIMIT' values and replacing missing 'MINIMUM_PAYMENTS' values with the median.
3. Dealing with outlier using Z Score
4. Employed a log transformation on specific features to standardize their distributions.
5. standardising the data using Standard_Scaler

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a process of examining and analyzing data in order to gain insights and understand the underlying patterns and relationships.
1. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the distribution and correlations among the attributes.
2. Employed kernel density plots to visualize the distributions of features.
3. Investigated feature correlations by utilizing a heatmap.

**Dimensionality Reduction:**
1. Employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to diminish the number of dimensions in the dataset while retaining 90% of the variation.
2. Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the dataset.

Clustering refers to the process of grouping similar items together based on their characteristics or attributes.
1. Utilized the KMeans clustering technique to categorize clients into separate groupings.
2. Employed the elbow approach and silhouette scores to ascertain the most suitable number of clusters.
3. Determine the optimal number of clusters by analyzing the outcomes of the elbow method and silhouette scores.

**Assessment:**
1. Assessed the caliber of the clusters by utilizing the silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index.
2. Evaluated the clustering algorithm's efficacy by interpreting the silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index.

**Representation:**
1.Depicting  most important Principal Components using spider plot.
2.Feature comparision of all clusters
**In conclusion:**
To summarize, the clustering technique unveiled separate segments of credit card clients according to their spending patterns. The identified clusters can assist organizations in customizing their marketing tactics and adapting their offers to more effectively cater to distinct client segments.

**Next Actions:**
1. Enhance the clustering algorithm and investigate other approaches.
2. Integrate supplementary functionalities or external data sources to improve the process of dividing into segments.
3. Employ a perpetual monitoring and updating process for the clustering model to effectively accommodate evolving client behaviors and market trends.
